I recommend to use [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson/), this works as well, but it is only for showcase and i do not support it anymore.

# ModelParser

ModelParser is tiny library for android JSON parsing. Not use any 3rd party library, it has zero dependencies.

## What it can do

- can convert a custom class to a JSONObject recursively
  
## Requirements:
Android api 4.3+:

Add to dependencies:
```
implementation 'com.github.gerp83:ModelParser:1.01'
```

## Examples
Very good examples can be found in the demo folder.

I hope this can make your job easier, happy auto parsing!
